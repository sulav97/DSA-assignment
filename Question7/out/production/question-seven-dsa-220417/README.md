# Task 7
Assignment: Graph-Based Recommendation System for a Social Media Application

Task Description:
You are tasked with designing and implementing a graph-based recommendation system for a social media
application, inspired by platforms like TikTok. The application should utilize graph algorithms and user
interactions to provide personalized content recommendations to users based on their interests and network
connections.

Requirements:
Design and implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using a suitable GUI framework, such as Java Swing or
JavaFX, to create an interactive social media application.
Implement a graph data structure that represents the social network, with nodes representing users and edges
representing connections or interactions between users.
Provide functionality for users to create accounts, follow other users, and interact with content (e.g., liking,
commenting, sharing).
Implement an algorithm to track user interactions and build a user profile based on their interests, preferences, and
network connections.
Design and implement a recommendation algorithm that utilizes graph traversal and analysis techniques to suggest
personalized content to users.
Consider factors such as user preferences, content popularity, and network influence in the recommendation
algorithm to provide diverse and engaging recommendations.
Implement a user interface that displays recommended content to users based on their profile and interactions.
Allow users to provide feedback on recommended content, such as liking or disliking, to further refine the
recommendation system.
Optimize the recommendation algorithm and data structures to handle large-scale social networks efficiently,
considering factors such as memory usage and computational complexity.
Test the application with a simulated user base and interactions to evaluate the effectiveness of the
recommendation system and the responsiveness of the GUI.
Consider implementing additional features to enhance the social media application, such as content filtering, user
search, or real-time content updates.

Grading Criteria:
1. The application should meet all the requirements mentioned above.
2. The user interface should be intuitive and easy to use.
3. The application should be bug-free and stable.
4. The application should be well-documented and commented.
5. Bonus points will be given for additional features, such as algorithms to find the most influential users or
to calculate the shortest path between two users.

Submission:
Submit the source code of the application along with a short report describing the features and functionalities of
the application. The report should also include any known bugs or issues and suggestions for future improvements.
The code should be well-organized and properly commented.
